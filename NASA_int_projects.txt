Compared to other parts of the world, Antarctica has many fascinating and distinctive features that can affect the local and even global climate. This research focuses on studying the properties of Antarctic clouds and blowing snow, and their interaction with the surface using observations from NASA satellites. Compared to clouds, blowing snow is less studied. Our studies have shown that snow be lifted up by wind and form spectacular blowing snow storms that extend hundreds of meters vertically and thousands of square miles horizontally. These storms can be seen from satellite observations and are very important to the earth's climate system. Depending on the background of the students, the tasks can range from separating clear from clouds and blowing snow using satellite imagery, determining their properties, to investigating their effects on the energy budget over Antarctica.

VIP - Hardware/Software Internship Developing Novel Planetary Robot Sensing

Type:
Internship

Session:
Spring 2019

Center:
Ames Research Center

Building:
269

Room:
101

Description:
Assistance is sought at Ames Research Center (ARC) on a research project developing novel sensing methodologies for mobility-limited planetary exploration robots. Research interest has grown in extending the reach of robotic planetary rovers or landers to enable exploration of caves, lava tubes, or other generally inaccessible terrain that may harbor trapped liquid water, exotic geologies, and possible life. Lander-only vehicles are inherently stationary, and existing rovers cannot negotiate such areas. Yet, only by accessing these regions can astrobiologists and geologists complete sampling tasks critical to such discoveries. To provide this reach, we are investigating projectile sensing methodologies in which expendable sensors are lobbed from a mortar-like delivery mechanism, perform sensing in flight, and anchor themselves to continue sensing and data return. These sensors can work in cooperation with mobile robots to extend their reach, provide situational awareness, and long-duration monitoring capabilities. Constellations of deployed sensors can cooperate, communicating wirelessly during flight and once anchored, to provide radio or illuminated landmarks aiding photography, mapping, and mobility operations. Sensor payloads may include cameras, environmental sensors, radio transceivers, and inertial sensors for trajectory reconstruction. A volunteer intern is sought to aid with the continuation and refinement of an existing prototype sensor launching system. This includes aspects of physical projectile design (including aerodynamic shaping), sensor payload selection, electrical/mechanical design and integration, embedded software development, and data processing. Opportunities are available to contribute to any or all of these areas. Specific focus at this time lies in improving projectile enclosure design to improve flight smoothness, expanding wireless communication capabilities, and integrating new sensors, but candidates with interest in any aspect of this work will be considered. Interns joining this project will have the opportunity to work closely with leading experts in robotic computer vision and embedded state estimation developing this system and will have a chance to participate in ongoing real-world trials analyzing the performance of these sensors. For the interested candidate, this presents the chance to greatly expand knowledge and experience in any of a broad number of areas in electronics, mechanisms, and software in cutting-edge research that will lead to important growth in robotic sensing capability vital for upcoming planetary exploration missions. This project is under the Volunteer Intern Program (VIP), it is a volunteer unpaid position. Additional forms will be required for VIP.

Computer/Software Skills:
Basic programming experience applicable to embedded electronics and/or experience with CAD design software is desired, depending on the aspects of the project of interest.

Technical Skills:
Basic experience in robotic sensing at a mechanical, electrical, and software level is desired. Stronger experience in one or more of these is a plus.

Other Skills:
Gaps in specific knowledge are fully expected and will be happily filled in by mentoring researchers. Being a quick learner with ambition and creativity to positively impact upcoming exploration missions is what matters!

Liquid Rocket Engine System Test Data Analysis Capability Development

Type:
Internship

Session:
Summer 2019

Center:
Marshall Space Flight Center

Building:
4203

Room:
4217

Description:
The MSFC Liquid Engine Systems Branch regularly performs assessment of rocket engine system test data for a variety of engines including SLS engines (RS-25 and RL10), Commercial Crew Program Engines (RD-180, RL10, and SpaceX Merlin variants), and in-house engine development projects. These data assessment activities help ensure engine testing meets the planned objectives and evaluates engine health for continued testing. The team is continuously developing tools to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and speed of the engineer’s data assessment efforts. A team of interns would participate in the development of multiple assessment tools and features amidst an agile development environment while learning about liquid rocket engine systems. Capability development areas include improving the technical insight, improving the workflow, and improving the presentation of the results; there are both technical and process dimensions to the efforts.

Computer/Software Skills:
The team uses a variety of analysis tools based in various program languages including Python, Fortran, Excel/VBA, Matlab, and C++. Python tends to be the language of choice for new capabilities. Some projects require multiple developers and will be worked as a team in a pseudo-agile development environment. Familiarity with this approach is helpful. Also, for these capabilities to outlast the presence of an intern, the ability to code and document any developments in a way that allows other users to learn, be effective, and modify any tools is critical. Visio capabilities would also be useful in developing integrated system schematics.

Technical Skills:
Engineering assessment of liquid rocket engine system test data involves an understanding of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, mechanical components (including valve and actuation systems, combustion devices, turbomachinery, etc.), instrumentation and data acquisition systems, control systems, test operations and design, and other areas. In particular, the systems team assesses the interactions between these various disciplines and components (i.e. technical integration). While knowledge of some of these disciplines/components and/or experience evaluating test data will be valuable, it is not considered essential for selection. This internship will provide the opportunity to expand knowledge in these areas. Computer skills and willingness to develop analysis tools is more critical than prerequisite technical knowledge and skills.

Other Skills:
To be effective, interns must be quick learners of both technical concepts and software tools. Interns must be resourceful in their learning and be able to utilize a combination of reference materials and intelligent questioning to develop their mental picture of the technical, organizational, and process dimensions. Assignments are rarely clear-cut, so an ability to be productive without having all of the information or answers already is critical. The ability to define the problem clearly is often more challenging than solving it in many systems tasks. Communication skills are essential to do this effectively. Both independent thinking and teamwork skills are critical. Intellectual curiosity is also a valuable for a systems engineer.

Description:
Systems Development utilizes the current software tools and technologies (Visual Studio .Net Framework) to develop custom applications for data analysis and design. Data mining uses pattern based queries, searches, or other analyses of one or more electronic databases in order to discover or locate a predictive pattern or anomaly indicative of lessons learned, or system failures. Throughout NASA, hundreds of data systems are designed and tailored to serve specific engineering and business needs. Many of these systems use relational algebra with structured query language to categorize and retrieve data. In these systems, data analyses are limited and require prior explicit knowledge of metadata and database relations; lacking exploratory data mining and discoveries. The purpose of this project is to infuse data mining techniques, methods and algorithms to improve data evaluations and analyses in NASA Data Systems.
